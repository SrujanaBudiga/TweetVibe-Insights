The " TweetVibe Insights : Unveiling World Event Analysis" project is the system utilizes a dataset of tweets stored in a CSV file ('Tweets.csv') for sentiment analysis. Text preprocessing is applied to enhance the quality of the textual data, including tasks such as converting to lowercase, removing punctuation, and eliminating stopwords. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is conducted to visualize the distribution of sentiments within the tweet dataset, employing count plots, pie charts, and word clouds. An ensemble model is constructed using a voting classifier, combining Multinomial Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression, contributing to improved sentiment prediction. Model evaluation involves assessing the ensemble model's performance on a test set using metrics like accuracy, a classification report, and a confusion matrix, providing insights into sentiment prediction effectiveness.
